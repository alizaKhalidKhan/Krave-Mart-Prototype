For my assignment, I improved the app with:

- **No More Popups:** Removed annoying address popups.
- **Chatbot Help:** Added a chatbot for post-order support.
- **Neat Categories:** Streamlined category organization.
- **Download Receipts:** Added receipt downloads.
- **Better Tracking:** Enhanced order tracking.

These changes make the app smoother and more user-friendly!
