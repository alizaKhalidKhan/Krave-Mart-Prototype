# Krave-Mart-Prototype
For my university assignment, I revamped the app to boost usability with these exciting updates:

- **Bye-Bye, Annoying Popups:** Banned the relentless address popups for a smoother experience.
- **Meet Your New Assistant:** Added a handy chatbot to handle all your post-order queries.
- **Categories Reimagined:** Redesigned categories for a cleaner, more intuitive navigation.
- **Receipt at Your Fingertips:** Added an easy option to download your order receipts.
- **Track Orders Like a Pro:** Enhanced the order tracking system for a more organized view.

These enhancements are all about making your app experience smoother, smarter, and more enjoyable!
